# Studies

This directory contains research and analysis documents that explore technical approaches, evaluate alternatives, and provide foundational knowledge for architectural decisions.

## Purpose

**Studies are pre-decision research documents** that:
- Investigate multiple solution approaches objectively
- Analyze trade-offs and constraints
- Document rejected alternatives with rationale
- Provide technical depth for team discussion
- Serve as basis for design decisions

## Relationship to Other Directories

## Workflow

1. **Research**: Create study document analyzing a technical problem
2. **Discussion**: Team reviews study, asks questions, evaluates options
3. **Decision**: Team makes architectural decision based on study findings
4. **Document**: Create design decision document referencing the study
5. **Implement**: Build according to design decision
6. **Document**: Update user/operator docs with implementation details

## Study Document Structure

Studies should include:

- **Problem statement**: What problem are we solving?
- **Requirements**: What constraints must be satisfied?
- **Options**: What approaches are available? (objective analysis)
- **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons for each option
- **Rejected alternatives**: What didn't we choose and why?
- **Open questions**: What needs further investigation?
- **References**: Sources, related work, code references

**Studies should NOT**:
- Prescribe a single solution (present options objectively)
- Include implementation details (keep conceptual)
- Make decisions (that's for design-decisions/)

## Active Studies

### Progressive Rollout
**Directory**: `progressive-rollout/`
**Status**: Requirements captured, Kargo evaluation complete, ready for team discussion
**Topic**: Progressive rollout framework for cross-environment and cross-region change propagation. Includes requirements for dual promotion model (component-level + bundle/snapshot), fast track, freeze mechanism, and a Kargo.io evaluation.
**Files**:
- `progressive-rollout/progressive-rollout.md` — requirements, constraints, and Kargo evaluation
- `progressive-rollout/initial-kargo-research.md` — detailed Kargo technical research (YAML examples, promotion steps, Stage DAG patterns, open-core analysis, alternatives comparison)
- `progressive-rollout/initial-spinnaker-research.md` — Spinnaker evaluation (conclusion: not viable due to push-based architecture and operational overhead)

### WIF Service Account Key Management
**File**: `wif-sa-key-management.md`
**Status**: Research complete, ready for team discussion
**Topic**: Secure management of service account signing keys for Workload Identity Federation

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case: `my-study-topic.md`
- Be descriptive: document should be discoverable by name
- Keep focused: one study per technical problem

## Related Directories

- `design-decisions/`: Final architectural decisions with rationale
- `docs/`: User and operator documentation
- `implementation-plans/`: Detailed implementation plans for features
- `PROJECTS/`: Jira story tracking and progress (different purpose than studies)
